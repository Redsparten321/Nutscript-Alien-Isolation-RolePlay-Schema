## Alien Isolation Roleplay ##

Alien Isolation is a game made by TCA (the Creative Assembly) and published by SEGA.
Alien Isolation is set in the future 2137, onboard a space station. You have been part of a vessel, 
that you went to find a flight recorder. This was your mothers. - I will leave that there for those who havent played it.

You have woken up from cryo sleep, and have been taken aboard a spacestation in the vast outer space systems.
You goal? 
Find help, and get off the station, but wait a creature lurks in the shadows, kill you off one, by one.
The bigger your group, the less likely someone else will interfere with you, but the bigger threat is not the
humans. The creature will lurk in thr shadows, and wait for the best chance to kill his prey, you!
You must fend off, with weapons, and stay alive. Yet the bullets do not effect this alien, so, you must use
your tactics and other ammunition to fend off.
The alien is hard to kill, and will be scared off by fire. 
(The alien will most likely not die, depending on the Owner of that server)
